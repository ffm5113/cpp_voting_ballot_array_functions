# cpp_voting_ballot_array_functions
The Voting Ballot Array Functions Program (C++) creates 3 arrays to store candidates, votes, and percentages to simulate a random election winner. The arrays are filled after the program reads an input file titled "Candidates.txt". Functions are used to pass the arrays and calculate the results, which are printed to the console &amp; an output file.
